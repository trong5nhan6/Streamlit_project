## Introduction

We will focus on exploring the **Streamlit library** , one of the widely developed and applied open-source libraries for deploying AI applications. **Streamlit** provides efficient tools for user interaction to input or display information. In the following sections, we will focus on developing the following basic applications:

1. **Chat Bot**
2. **Word Correction**
3. **Object Detection**

#### 1 Chat Bot
The Chat Bot application has seen significant development in recent years, primarily focusing on large language models that can effectively interact with user requests.

#### 2 Word Correction
Word Correction is one of the basic applications of natural language processing, aimed at developing applications that take an input word and, through an error correction model, convert it to the correct word if it is misspelled.

#### 3 Object Detection
Object Detection is a prominent and essential application of image processing, designed to detect bounding boxes containing objects within an image.
